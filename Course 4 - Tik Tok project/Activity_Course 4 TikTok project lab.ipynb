It allows for the identification of patterns, trends, and outliers, which are crucial for forming hypotheses and making decisions about the next steps in the analysis. Descriptive statistics such as mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and quartiles will give us insights into the spread and variability of the data, helping to determine whether the data is normally distributed or skewed. Additionally, understanding the distribution and central tendency of key variables is vital when deciding on the most appropriate statistical tests for hypothesis testing or for identifying relationships between variables.\n",
