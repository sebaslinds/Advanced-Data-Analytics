    "\n",
    "What are the ethical implications of the model? What are the consequences of your model making errors?\n",
    "There are serious ethical concerns:\n",
    "\n",
    "The model could lead to bias or discrimination, especially if features like location or time of day correlate with certain socioeconomic or demographic groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "Drivers might alter their behavior (e.g., provide lower quality service or avoid picking up certain passengers), which could worsen customer experience and reinforce unfair treatment.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the likely effect of a false negative (model predicts a tip when there is none)?\n",
    "The driver expects a tip but doesn't receive one. This may lead to frustration or disappointment, but the passenger would still receive unbiased service if the driver relied on the model’s advice.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the likely effect of a false positive (model predicts no tip, but customer actually tips)?\n",
    "This is more harmful. Drivers might provide poorer service or be less respectful, leading to a poor experience for generous customers, potentially harming the driver’s own earnings or the company’s reputation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Do the benefits of such a model outweigh the potential problems?\n",
    "In its current form, no. The risks of reinforcing unfair treatment or discrimination are high. The potential for harm outweighs the operational benefit of \"warning\" drivers about non-tippers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Would you proceed with the request to build this model? Why or why not?\n",
    "Not as currently defined. Predicting non-tippers introduces ethical risks, including reinforcing bias and affecting customer experience. A better approach would be to encourage positive behaviors (e.g., identifying generous tippers) rather than penalizing perceived negative ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "Can the objective be modified to make it less problematic?\n",
    "Yes. The model could instead be used to identify highly generous tippers. This would shift the model’s purpose from warning to positive reinforcement, helping drivers optimize their service for high-value passengers without biasing them against others."

If your data does not contain predictive signal, even the most complex algorithm will not be able to deliver consistent and accurate predictions. Do not be afraid to draw this conclusion. Even if you cannot use the model to make strong predictions, was the work done in vain? Consider any insights that you could report back to stakeholders."
