    "To best prepare for understanding and organizing the provided **driver data** for the Waze Project, consider the following steps, using the available fields:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Explore the Dataset**\n",
    "\n",
    "Begin by loading and inspecting the dataset using Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Load the Data**: Use pandas to load the dataset into a DataFrame.\n",
    "* **Preview the Data**: Check the first few rows using `.head()` and the dataset's structure with `.info()` to understand the columns and their data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Review the Data Dictionary**\n",
    "\n",
    "From the fields provided, we can infer the following meaning for each:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **ID**: A unique identifier for each driver or session.\n",
    "* **label**: The classification label associated with each session, possibly indicating whether a session is a \"claim\" or \"non-claim\" or some other form of categorization.\n",
    "* **sessions**: The number of sessions a driver has participated in.\n",
    "* **drives**: The number of individual driving events or trips for each driver.\n",
    "* **total\\_sessions**: The total number of sessions the driver has completed.\n",
    "* **n\\_days\\_after\\_onboarding**: The number of days since the driver first used the app or was onboarded.\n",
    "* **total\\_navigations\\_fav1**: The total number of navigations using the first favorite route.\n",
    "* **total\\_navigations\\_fav2**: The total number of navigations using the second favorite route.\n",
    "* **driven\\_km\\_drives**: The total kilometers driven across all drives.\n",
    "* **duration\\_minutes\\_drives**: The total duration of the driving events, measured in minutes.\n",
    "* **activity\\_days**: The number of days the driver has been active in the app.\n",
    "* **driving\\_days**: The number of days the driver has actively driven.\n",
    "* **device**: The device used by the driver (e.g., iOS or Android).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Identify Key Variables**\n",
    "\n",
    "From the fields above, the following variables seem especially relevant for understanding driver behavior:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Driving Metrics**: `drives`, `driven_km_drives`, `duration_minutes_drives`, `total_sessions`, and `driving_days` will provide insights into how much and how often the driver is active. These are key to understanding overall driving activity and usage patterns.\n",
    "* **Navigation Behavior**: `total_navigations_fav1` and `total_navigations_fav2` indicate how often the driver uses favorite routes, potentially influencing behavior or outcomes.\n",
    "* **Driver Engagement**: `sessions`, `activity_days`, and `n_days_after_onboarding` can give a sense of how engaged and active the driver is with the app, as well as how quickly they adopt it after onboarding.\n",
    "* **Device**: The `device` field might be important to consider if device type affects app behavior, performance, or driver engagement.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Missing Data**: Check for missing values and decide whether to fill, drop, or otherwise handle them.\n",
    "* **Outliers**: Look for extreme values in fields like `driven_km_drives` and `duration_minutes_drives`, as they may skew analysis or model results.\n",
    "* **Categorical Variables**: The `device` field may require encoding (e.g., one-hot encoding) if it is used in any models.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. **Formulate Initial Hypotheses**\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the data, we can hypothesize relationships and insights:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Engagement and Driving Behavior**: Drivers who have been using the app for more days (`n_days_after_onboarding`, `activity_days`) are likely to have higher driving activity (measured by `drives`, `driven_km_drives`).\n",
    "* **Navigation Preferences**: Drivers who frequently use their favorite routes (`total_navigations_fav1`, `total_navigations_fav2`) might exhibit more predictable driving patterns.\n",
    "* **Device Impact**: There might be differences in driving behavior or session frequency based on the device type (iOS vs. Android), suggesting that app performance or driver preferences differ by platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "By thoroughly exploring these fields and reviewing their relationships, we can effectively prepare to **analyze**, **construct**, and **execute** your models or evaluations in later stages of the project."

    "\n",
    "Recall that your supervisor, May Santer, asked you to share your findings with the data team in an executive summary. Consider the following questions as you prepare to write your summary. Think about key points you may want to share with the team, and what information is most relevant to the user churn project.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Questions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Did the data contain any missing values? How many, and which variables were affected? Was there a pattern to the missing data?\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, the dataset contained 700 rows with missing values in the label column, which indicates whether a user churned or was retained. No other columns appeared to have missing values.\n",
    "A pattern was identified: 63.9% of the users with missing labels were iPhone users, while 36.1% were Android users. This distribution is consistent with the device ratio in the complete data, so there’s no indication of device-based bias in the missing labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What is a benefit of using the median value of a sample instead of the mean?\n",
    "\n",
    "The median is less sensitive to extreme outliers than the mean. This makes it a more accurate representation of a \"typical\" user in datasets where values like driven_km_drives can be skewed by a small number of users driving extremely long distances (e.g., over 21,000 km in a month).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Did your investigation give rise to further questions that you would like to explore or ask the Waze team about?\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes. The data suggest that users who churned were extremely active drivers, with high kilometers and drives per driving day. This raises questions such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "Are these users professional drivers (e.g., long-haul truckers)?\n",
    "\n",
    "If so, does the Waze app lack features tailored to their needs?\n",
    "\n",
    "Could customizing the app experience for super-drivers reduce churn?\n",
    "\n",
    "4. What percentage of the users in the dataset were Android users and what percentage were iPhone users?\n",
    "\n",
    "Android users: 35.5%\n",
    "\n",
    "iPhone users: 64.5%\n",
    "\n",
    "5. What were some distinguishing characteristics of users who churned vs. users who were retained?\n",
    "\n",
    "Compared to retained users, churned users:\n",
    "\n",
    "Had more drives per month (median of 51 vs. 48)\n",
    "\n",
    "Drove ~200 km more and spent ~2.5 more hours driving per month\n",
    "\n",
    "Had fewer driving days (11 vs. 12), but did more drives per driving day (7.45 vs. 3.75)\n",
    "\n",
    "Drove longer distances per driving day (median of 523 km vs. 263 km)\n",
    "\n",
    "These users were intense app users over fewer days, which may suggest a distinct segment.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Was there an appreciable difference in churn rate between iPhone users vs. Android users?\n",
    "\n",
    "No. The percentage of iPhone and Android users within both the churned and retained groups was nearly identical:\n",
    "\n",
    "Churned: 64.9% iPhone, 35.1% Android\n",
    "\n",
    "Retained: 64.4% iPhone, 35.6% Android\n",
    "\n",
    "This suggests that device type did not significantly affect churn behavior in this dataset."
