    "As you're learning, data professionals working on modeling projects use featuring engineering to help them determine which attributes in the data can best predict certain measures.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this activity, you are working for a firm that provides insights to the National Basketball Association (NBA), a professional North American basketball league. You will help NBA managers and coaches identify which players are most likely to thrive in the high-pressure environment of professional basketball and help the team be successful over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, you will analyze a subset of data that contains information about NBA players and their performance records. You will conduct feature engineering to determine which features will most effectively predict whether a player's NBA career will last at least five years. The insights gained then will be used in the next stage of the project: building the predictive model.\n"

    "It is important to check class balance because imbalanced datasets can bias machine learning models toward the majority class, leading to misleading performance metrics. For example, a model might predict the majority class very well but perform poorly on the minority class — which may be the more critical one to predict correctly. Understanding class distribution helps inform decisions about model choice, evaluation metrics (like precision, recall, and F1-score), and whether techniques like resampling or class weighting are needed."

    "Feature transformation is essential in machine learning because most algorithms require numerical input to perform calculations and make predictions. Transforming raw data into a form that can be understood by machine learning models can significantly impact the model's performance. Key reasons include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Consistency with Model Requirements: Many machine learning algorithms (such as regression, decision trees, or neural networks) expect numerical inputs. Categorical variables, like \"name\" or \"team,\" must be converted into numerical representations using techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding.\n",
    "\n",
    "Improved Model Performance: Some models may struggle with non-numeric data because they can't process categorical variables directly. Feature encoding allows the model to understand the data's structure and relationships, leading to better performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Enabling Feature Interaction: Transformations like scaling or normalization allow features to have comparable magnitudes, making it easier for models to identify patterns between features. This is especially useful when using algorithms sensitive to the scale of data, such as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) or Support Vector Machines (SVM).\n",
    "\n",
    "Handling Missing Data: Feature transformation techniques can also help deal with missing or inconsistent data (e.g., filling missing values, encoding missing categories), which helps ensure a more robust model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Are Transformations Necessary for the Features in Our Data?\n",
    "Upon reviewing the dataset, the following transformations might be necessary:\n",
    "\n",
    "Categorical Data: The only categorical feature in the data, in our case, is the \"name\" column, which we do not need for predictions. We will not include this column in the feature set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Numerical Data: Most of the features in the dataset, such as points, assists, field goals, rebounds, etc., are already numeric. However, we might need scaling or normalization if the features have vastly different ranges (for example, \"points\" might range in the tens, while \"minutes\" could be in the hundreds).\n",
    "\n",
    "Scaling: It's beneficial to scale numerical features (e.g., using Min-Max scaling or Standard scaling) to make the data suitable for models sensitive to feature scales (like logistic regression or SVM).\n",
